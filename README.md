Selectable Grid Component The SelectableGrid is a dynamic React component designed to create a grid of selectable boxes. By leveraging React's state and event handling capabilities, users can interact with the grid to select multiple boxes either individually or in rectangular clusters. This implementation emphasizes user engagement and demonstrates efficient state management for interactive elements.

Key Features:

1. Grid Customization: The component accepts rows and cols props, allowing users to configure the grid's size.

2. Mouse Interactivity: Users can click and drag across the grid to select multiple boxes in a rectangular region.

3. Dynamic Rendering: The selected boxes are visually highlighted, making user interaction intuitive.

4. Event Handling: React's useState and useCallback hooks manage user interactions and optimize performance.

Implementation Details:

1. State Management: Two states, isMouseDown and selectedBoxes, track mouse events and the currently selected boxes.

2. Event Handlers:

a. handleMouseDown: Initiates selection from the clicked box.

b. handleMouseEnter: Extends selection dynamically as the mouse moves.

c. handleMouseUp: Resets interaction mode when the user releases the mouse button.

d.Logic for Selection: Calculates the rectangular region of selected boxes based on the start and end positions during dragging, ensuring accurate selection.

e. Styling Flexibility: The grid's dimensions and styling can be customized using CSS variables for --rows and --cols.
